.apks of Android apps I have built

Photo Fighter, the Android app I made as part of the Embedded Systems 3 coursework (May 2012).
It is a fighting game, where the fighters are created from real users.
About 4 days were spent on making this app, one of the first apps that I developed. 
In order to play, at least one fighter needs to be created from the Personalize screen.
It was tested with a HTC Desire S device running Android 4.0.4.

Features:
* Create Fighter with photos and voice recordings
* Edit Fighter
* Artificially Intelligent opponent

Not implemented features:
* Help
* Manage Arenas

Known issues:
* As it was only tested with an HTC Desire S, the UI might differ in other devices, but the functionality should stay unaffected
* The audio latency during the fight is high
* The voice recordings' volume is low, so the user has to speak louder when recording
* There is no feedback when pressing buttons and recording voice
